      <h2>Games I have been playing</h2>  
        <ul>
          <li>CSGO</li>
          <li>Fortnite Chapter 2</li>
          <li>Terraria 1.4</li>

          <li>Devil May Cry 5</li>
          <li>Destiny</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I have dropped a lot of hours into these games, in CSGO alone I have played about 550 hours, and this has been from Janurary. Other games like Minecraft I just will continue to put hours into, same with Terraria. I have played a lot of VR but the two gamse I have played the most have been Pavlov and Beat Saber. I am mostly into multiplayer games but I do try some singleplayer games like Borderlands 3 and Devil May Cry which were pretty good. One game I was looking forward to almost all year was Minecraft Dungeons, this game was a total let down and has about 1 days of content in it and it doesn't feel finished. I have played other games as well but did not want to make the list any bigger. I'    m a gamer</p>

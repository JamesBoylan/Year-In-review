      YEAR IN REVIEW
    </h1>
    <p>
      This year has been quite eventful for me. I started my sophmore year of highschool. This year has been pretty easy so far and I have enjoyed it. But school was not the only thing that was important to me this year. Just under a year ago I upgraded my pc to the beast that it is and have been using it almost every day. I have gotten back into game like CSGO and started new games like Valorant. Another game that has been big for this year has been Terraria, and I was hyped almost the entire time for 1.4 update which came out and I played the entirety of. Also as of today I began to play Minecraft Dungeons, which has been a major let down. The game sucks and is stail, and I have almost beat it entirely in 3 hours becasue there is no content. Game have been a huge thing for me this year. They have been very helpful in this quartentine lockdown because of COVID-19.
